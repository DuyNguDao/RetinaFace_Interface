- Dataset evaluate: 300-W, LFPW
    AFLW dataset [6]: This dataset contains 21080 more challenging in-the-wild faces with large poses ( with a yaw from
    -90°to 90°) and each is annotated with no more than 21 visible landmarks, which is suitable for evaluating alignment
    performance over large poses
- Plot:
+ y-label: NME
+ x-label: Left eye center, left mouth corner, nose tip, right eye center, right mouth corner
||a-b||2 = sqrt((ax-bx)**2 + (ay-by)**2)
L = sqrt(W*H), W: weight of face box, H: height of face box
